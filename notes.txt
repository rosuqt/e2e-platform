Ways to combat limited job pool (since STI college lng nmn to what company wud wanna 
post here (unless partnered ka ng school)).
-Beneficial for partnered companies (no need for in school meetings, since pede veriffy online)

IDEAS to make it better kht wla masyado company mag aapply
-Student Recommended Job Listings
    -students shud be able to recommend jobs they see online/applied for (then be verified 
    by a coor admin).
    -how it would look like. Only be able to post job title, company then link

-Self input job lilstings by coor  
    -same with first one pero by coordinators,

How would application tracking work here?
If clicking APPLY button for Recommended jobs, it will open a tab
the system will then open a modal (Did you apply? Yes or No) pag yes automatically
stored like any normal applciation (BUT further status will be manually set by the student)
Siguro we shud just make this required ganon
-OJT coor shud be able to manually post jobs

Mark task
(Ask who are the current partneredcompanies)

Everyone
-Get a list na of possible companies we can invite (find atleast 3 for each member)
